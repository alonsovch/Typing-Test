# Typing-Test

Typing Test by Alonso Herrera

Project from a YouTube idea, started from scratch.

This is a Typing Test or words counter per minute made in Python. This is just for fun and for educational purposes.

To run the program you must install window-curses. Go to your terminal and go to the path in which is the folder, then execute the command "pip install window-curses".
