# Typing-Test

This is a Typing Test or words counter per minute made in Python > 3.6 . This is just for fun and for educational purposes.

To run the program you must install the window-curses module from Python. Go to your terminal and go to the path in which is the directory, then execute the command "pip install windows-curses".

This program works under the usage of 3 Python libraries: curses, time and random. I tried to wrote the code properly documented so the user understands clearly how the code works. Also if you're not familiarized running these kind of codes I'm gonna explain in a few lines how to run it on your cmd.

First of all download this folder, then from your cmd execute "cd " + the path where your download folder is. Then type "cd main.py" and press Enter. After that you should do what I wrote about the installation of the windows-curses.
Then, after you've done all of that you should be able to run the code with any problems typing in the cmd (Of course being in the directory path) "python main.py".

Thank you for reading and trying this program!
